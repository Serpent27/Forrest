# Forrest Encryption
#### Created by Alex Anderson < parsec29@protonmail.com >

*Forrest Gump does calculus.*

### An important note:
This algorithm is primarily made as a reference to a dumb simile I made in a [Stack Exchange discussion](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/). It's not meant to be secure, but if my theory is right it probably will be anyway.

That said, I wouldn't bet on it. If you want to trust this algorithm for your secrets, you do so at your own risk...

### What is Forrest?

A joke. A *very* nerdy joke.

## Forrest, what happened?

"I saw you doing math and was wondering if you're OK."
- "Yeah, I'm studying to become a cartigrifur"
"You mean a *cryptographer*?"
- "I'm pretty sure it's cartifrifear..."
"Whatever. Why do you wanna be a cryptographer?"
- "Certififor! Idiot. I hit my head and now I'm smart."
"You hit your head?"
- "Yeah, REALLY hard and now I'm smart!"
"Ok... That definitely explains a few things..."
"Even for you."
- "Isn't it great?!"
"Yeah... Ok"

### Since Forrest Gump forgot how to multiply
after hitting his head (wait... he used to *know* how to multiply?), he made this algorithm with only constant-time operations.
Although we're not sure how he managed to multiply by 23 - we're pretty sure it was an accident.
